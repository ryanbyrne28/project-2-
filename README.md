Watch Shop Project 2
A watch market showing available watches for purchase and the ability to post a watch for sale.

I implemented a simple joke generator using CRUD and ajax as well as JS to render the store 

Some of the challenges I faced:

Entire CSS and overall user interface.  I wanted to keep it as simple and user friendly as possinle, not complicating the buying process.
Setting up the Heroku deployment



Features
Buy a watch, Post a watch, edit a watch listing.

Technologies Used
HTML
JavaScript
CSS
AJAX
CRUD Routes

Future Enhancements
Ability to input a shopping cart section and an actual payment process
